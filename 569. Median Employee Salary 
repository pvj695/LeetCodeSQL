Write a SQL query to find the median salary of each company. Bonus points if you can solve it without using any built-in SQL functions.

Solution:

with CTE AS(
    SELECT Company, count(*) as ct from Employee
    GROUP BY Company
    ),
 CTE1 AS(
    SELECT id,Company, Salary, ROW_NUMBER() OVER(PARTITION BY Company order by Salary) as RN from Employee
 )
SELECT Id, c1.Company, Salary FROM CTE1 c1
JOIN CTE c on c.Company = c1.Company
where (ct%2!=0 and rn =ct/2+1 ) or
(ct%2=0 and (rn = ct/2 or  rn=ct/2+1))
