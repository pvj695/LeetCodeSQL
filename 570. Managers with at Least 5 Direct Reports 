The Employee table holds all employees including their managers. Every employee has an Id, and there is also a column for the manager Id.

+------+----------+-----------+----------+
|Id    |Name 	  |Department |ManagerId |
+------+----------+-----------+----------+
|101   |John 	  |A 	      |null      |
|102   |Dan 	  |A 	      |101       |
|103   |James 	  |A 	      |101       |
|104   |Amy 	  |A 	      |101       |
|105   |Anne 	  |A 	      |101       |
|106   |Ron 	  |B 	      |101       |

Given the Employee table, write a SQL query that finds out managers with at least 5 direct report. For the above table, your SQL query should return:

+-------+
| Name  |
+-------+
| John  |
+-------+

Solution:

with CTE AS(
select ManagerId, count(*) c from Employee group by ManagerId having count(*) >=5)

SELECT NAME FROM Employee e
JOIN CTE c on c.ManagerId = e.id
