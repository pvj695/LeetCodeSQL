SQL Schema
The Employee table holds all employees. Every employee has an Id, and there is also a column for the department Id.

+----+-------+--------+--------------+
| Id | Name  | Salary | DepartmentId |
+----+-------+--------+--------------+
| 1  | Joe   | 85000  | 1            |
| 2  | Henry | 80000  | 2            |
| 3  | Sam   | 60000  | 2            |
| 4  | Max   | 90000  | 1            |
| 5  | Janet | 69000  | 1            |
| 6  | Randy | 85000  | 1            |
| 7  | Will  | 70000  | 1            |
+----+-------+--------+--------------+
The Department table holds all departments of the company.

+----+----------+
| Id | Name     |
+----+----------+
| 1  | IT       |
| 2  | Sales    |
+----+----------+
Write a SQL query to find employees who earn the top three salaries in each of the department. For the above tables, your SQL query should return the following rows (order of rows does not matter).

+------------+----------+--------+
| Department | Employee | Salary |
+------------+----------+--------+
| IT         | Max      | 90000  |
| IT         | Randy    | 85000  |
| IT         | Joe      | 85000  |
| IT         | Will     | 70000  |
| Sales      | Henry    | 80000  |
| Sales      | Sam      | 60000  |
+------------+----------+--------+


Solution:


	WITH CTE AS (
	SELECT DepartmentId,Salary as S,
	DENSE_RANK()OVER(PARTITION BY DepartmentId ORDER BY Salary DESC ) as DN
	FROM Employee
	)

	SELECT DISTINCT D.Name as Department
	, e.Name AS Employee, (Salary) AS Salary
	FROM Employee e 
	JOIN (SELECT * FROM CTE WHERE DN < 4 ) as e1
	    ON e1.DepartmentId = e.DepartmentId and e1.s = e.Salary
	JOIN Department D ON e.DepartmentId = d.Id
	order by 1
