Write an SQL query that reports the average experience years of all the employees for each project, rounded to 2 digits.

The query result format is in the following example:

Project table:
+-------------+-------------+
| project_id  | employee_id |
+-------------+-------------+
| 1           | 1           |
| 1           | 2           |
| 1           | 3           |
| 2           | 1           |
| 2           | 4           |
+-------------+-------------+

Employee table:
+-------------+--------+------------------+
| employee_id | name   | experience_years |
+-------------+--------+------------------+
| 1           | Khaled | 3                |
| 2           | Ali    | 2                |
| 3           | John   | 1                |
| 4           | Doe    | 2                |
+-------------+--------+------------------+

Result table:
+-------------+---------------+
| project_id  | average_years |
+-------------+---------------+
| 1           | 2.00          |
| 2           | 2.50          |
+-------------+---------------+
The average experience years for the first project is (3 + 2 + 1) / 3 = 2.00 and for the second project is (3 + 2) / 2 = 2.50

Solution:

SELECT p.project_id, CAST((SUM(experience_years)*1.0)/count(project_id) AS NUMERIC(16,2)) average_years
FROM Project p
JOIN Employee E on E.employee_id = p.employee_id
group by p.project_id
