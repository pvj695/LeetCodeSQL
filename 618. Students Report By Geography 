A U.S graduate school has students from Asia, Europe and America. The students' location information are stored in table student as below.
 

| name   | continent |
|--------|-----------|
| Jack   | America   |
| Pascal | Europe    |
| Xi     | Asia      |
| Jane   | America   |
 

Pivot the continent column in this table so that each name is sorted alphabetically and displayed underneath its corresponding continent. The output headers should be America, Asia and Europe respectively. It is guaranteed that the student number from America is no less than either Asia or Europe.

Solution:

/* Write your T-SQL query statement below */

with cte as(
SELECT *, ROW_NUMBER()OVER(partition by continent order by name) as rn from Student 
)
select 
max(CASE WHEN continent ='America' THEN name end) as America,
max(CASE WHEN continent ='Asia' THEN name end) as Asia,
max(CASE WHEN continent ='Europe' THEN name end) as Europe
from cte
group by rn
